Jupyter Notebook is an interactive environment that allows you to write and execute code, visualize data, and document your analysis in a single document. It's widely used by data scientists, researchers, and educators to perform data analysis, machine learning experiments, and much more.\n\n## What is Python?\n\nPython is a versatile and powerful programming language that's known for its simplicity and readability. It's widely used in various domains such as web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. In this notebook, we'll primarily focus on using Python for data analysis and basic programming tasks.\n\n## How to Use This Notebook\n\nEach cell in this notebook can contain either code (Python in our case) or Markdown text (like this cell). To run a code cell, simply click on it to select it and then press `Shift + Enter` or click the \"Run\" button in the toolbar above. The output, if any, will appear below the cell.\n\nFeel free to modify and experiment with the code cells. Don't hesitate to break things – that's how we learn! If you ever encounter any issues, you can always restart the notebook by clicking on \"Kernel\" > \"Restart\" in the menu.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nBefore we dive into coding, let's ensure you have everything set up. If you're new to Jupyter Notebook, it's recommended to have a basic understanding of Python syntax. If you're not familiar with Python, don't worry – we'll start with the basics and gradually build up our knowledge.\n\nThroughout this notebook, we'll cover:\n- Printing and variables\n- Data types and data structures\n- Control flow (if statements, loops)\n- Functions and libraries\n\nLet's begin our Python journey!\n",

      "source": "# Arithmetic Expressions in Python\n\nArithmetic expressions are fundamental mathematical operations that can be performed using Python. These expressions allow you to perform calculations involving numbers, variables, and operators. Python supports a variety of arithmetic operators for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.\n\n## Basic Arithmetic Operators\n\nHere are some examples of basic arithmetic operations using Python:\n\n1. Addition: `2 + 3` equals 5\n2. Subtraction: `10 - 5` equals 5\n3. Multiplication: `4 * 6` equals 24\n4. Division: `15 / 3` equals 5.0 (floating-point result)\n5. Integer Division: `15 // 3` equals 5 (integer result)\n6. Modulus (Remainder): `17 % 5` equals 2\n\n## Operator Precedence\n\nPython follows the standard rules of operator precedence when evaluating arithmetic expressions. Here's a quick reminder of the precedence order:\n\n1. Parentheses `()`\n2. Exponentiation `**`\n3. Multiplication `*`, Division `/`, Integer Division `//`, Modulus `%`\n4. Addition `+`, Subtraction `-`\n\nRemember that you can use parentheses to control the order of operations and create more complex expressions.\n\n## Variables in Arithmetic Expressions\n\nYou can also use variables in arithmetic expressions:\n\n```python\nx = 10\ny = 3\nresult = x + y * 2  # Evaluates to 16\n",
